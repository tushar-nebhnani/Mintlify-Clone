# Mintlify Landing Page Clone

A pixel-perfect, high-fidelity recreation of the [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) landing page. This project demonstrates modern front-end development techniques using semantic HTML5 and advanced CSS3, focusing on responsiveness, glassmorphism, and precise layout structures.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a static landing page built from scratch to replicate the sleek, "Enterprise-grade" design aesthetic of Mintlify. It features a complex hero section with glass effects, a responsive grid for customer stories, and a detailed footer.

**Live Demo:** [https://mintlify-clone-tushar.netlify.app/]

## ✨ Key Features

* **Glassmorphism Effects:** Custom `backdrop-filter` and semi-transparent borders used in the Hero email input and navigation elements.
* **Responsive Layouts:**
    * **CSS Grid:** Used for the "Customer Stories" and "Footer Links" sections to handle complex multi-column layouts.
    * **Flexbox:** Used for the Navbar, Hero alignment, and feature lists to ensure perfect centering and spacing.
* **Pure CSS Styling:** No external frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind) were used. All gradients, shadows, and transitions are hand-coded.
* **SVG Integration:** All icons (social media, UI elements, logos) are embedded directly as SVGs for fast loading and crisp scaling.
* **Interactive Elements:**
    * Hover effects on customer cards (lift + shadow).
    * Focus states on input fields (glow effect).
    * Animated buttons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`).
* **CSS3:** Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries, Animations.
* **Assets:** SVG Icons (embedded).
